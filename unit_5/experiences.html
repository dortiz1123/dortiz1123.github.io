			<h3>Right to Work</h3>

				<p>My workplace experiences began with various jobs like a shop mechanic at an HVAC company, an ice scooper at Baskin- Robbins, a bouncer at a local bar, and a salesperson at a sporting goods store. I acquired many skills while employed at these establishments, but one major interest; how do I run a business? My inquisitiveness in the topic lead me to pursue a career in accounting, because I believe accountants have the best view, an aggregate view, of all businesses.   It’s an aggregate, and complete view of the inner-workings of an enterprise, analyzing the financial details in order to assess the company’s well being.  I see it as watching the implementation of your company’s strategic goals from the inside out.</p>

		<p>I started my accounting career at a small CPA firm in “The Diamond District” in New York City.  As one can presume, most of our clients were local jewelry retailers and manufacturers in the area. Here I learned about what is necessary to open a business. I learned the importance of submitting the proper filings and obtaining the mandatory certifications to operate a business in a certain state. Also I learn bookkeeping, and it’s usefulness to the success of a business. Finally, I learn about taxes, and its affect on a business. I became so intrigued by the work, I chose to go and register for classes at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, and learn more.</p>

		<p>While at the CPA firm, I saw an opportunity to join the National Hemophilia Foundation, and learn the similarities and differences of a company, whose main purpose is to serve its constituents, as opposed to making a profit. At NHF, I was able to strengthen my customer service skills.  I grew as a team player, and discovered a concept called corporate social responsibility. I believe everyone should work for a charitable organization once in their lifetime.</p> 

		<p>My biggest challenge in my pursuit for knowledge was to change my career direction. I decided to aim for a Bachelor’s degree in sport management of all things. As an avid fan, and sometimes participant, I experience all the emotional and entertainment aspect of sport. I figured why not learn more about sports from a business perspective, and I went all-in. I started classes at Post University through their online teaching platform. At the same time, I planned the creation of a new business venture, Sharp Edge Sports Collectibles LLC  (a passion project), and began implementing plan. It’s a continued work in progress, but it’s also a great learning experience. I’m collecting an enormous amount of information, enhance my skills in technology, and become more creative. It’s the hardest job I ever had, but the most gratifying.</p>
