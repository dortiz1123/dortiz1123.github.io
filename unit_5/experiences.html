			<h3>Right to Work</h3>

				<p>My workplace experiences began with various jobs like a shop mechanic at an HVAC company, an ice scooper at Baskin- Robbins, a bouncer at a local bar, and a salesperson at a sporting goods store. I acquired many skills while employed at these establishments, but one major interest; how do I run a business? I thought "What career would allow me to view the total operations of a business from al sides"? Accounting.</p>

				<p>I always thought accountants have the best view, an aggregate view, of all businesses. Through financial analysis, accountants can tell you about the inner-workings of any enterprise. Accountants are both historians and fortune tellers. They have the ability to use past facts to make current decision with hopes of a specific future outcome. The numbers tell a story.</p>

			<p>I started my accounting career at a small CPA firm in “The Diamond District” in New York City.  As one can presume, most of our clients were local jewelry retailers and manufacturers in the area. Here I learned about what is necessary to open a business. I learned the importance of submitting the proper filings and obtaining the mandatory certifications to operate a business in a certain state. Also I learn bookkeeping, and it’s usefulness to the success of a business. I also learned terms like organizational skills and time-management. I became an effective worker.This experience prompted me to explore more and register for classes at the Borough of Manhattan Community College.</p>

			<p>While at the CPA firm, I saw an opportunity to join the National Hemophilia Foundation, and learn the similarities and differences of a company, whose main purpose is to serve its constituents, as opposed to making a profit. Here, I gained many of those intangibles that not only make you a sharp teammate, but a great human being. NHF taught me the importance of community, diversity, team and tolerance. I felt like my work had a greater purpose than just the numbers. I really believe everyone should work for a charitable organization once in their lifetime.</p>

			<p>My biggest challenge in my pursuit for knowledge was to change my career direction. I decided to aim for a Bachelor’s degree in sport management of all things. As an avid fan, and sometimes participant, I experience all the emotional and entertainment aspect of sport. I figured why not learn more about sports from a business perspective, and I went all-in.</p> 
			
			<p>I started classes at Post University through their online teaching platform. At the same time, I planned the creation of a new business venture, Sharp Edge Sports Collectibles LLC  (a passion project), and began implementing my plan. It’s a continued work in progress, but it’s also a great learning experience. I'm currently learning HTML5 and CSS in order to build a functional and efficient website for Sharp Edge and of course, this website you're reading now. It’s the hardest job I ever had, but the most gratifying.</p>
