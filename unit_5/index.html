					<p id="introA">Employers in this country and around the world seek dynamic partners who can provide their companies with the following standard qualifications:</p>
					<ul id="introB">
						<li>An experienced and knowledgeable employee, capable of performing their tasks and duties</li>
						<li>Someone who's motivated and focused enough to help accomplished the goals of the company as well as their own professional goals</li>
						<li>Someone who can independently work at a high level, yet can perform successfully with their fellow team members.</li>
					</ul>
					<p id="introC">Even with all these attributes, it's the intangibles that make potential employees stand out. This website will allow potential employers and others, not only view my professional qualifications, but also allows them to view me as a person, with a specific cultural and environmental background, personal life stories, and various interest and passions. My name <a href="../unit_5/about.html">David Ortiz</a>, and this my open book for all to see.</p>

					<p id="introD">Please feel free to <a href="mailto:dortiz1123@hotmail.com">contact me</a> if you wish to discuss my professional aptitude, or if you just want to say hi.</p>
