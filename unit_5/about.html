			<p>I can best describe myself as a sports-loving nerd, who tries to learn everything about things I find interesting. While some interest turn into hobbies and entertainment, others create passion. Passion can make you love what you do. It can make you seek knowledge. It can make you a productive and responsible person. It can make you enjoy life.</p>
